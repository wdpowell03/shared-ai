You are building a real-time, collaborative AI chat workspace for your team, powered by Next.js, Supabase, and OpenAI. The core idea is to create a shared environment where you and your boss (or other collaborators) can chat together with a persistent context—meaning, all users see the same conversation history, and every new AI response draws from the full, collective back-and-forth. This is especially useful for project ideation, documenting decisions, and keeping your “project brain” in one searchable place.

The app works by organizing conversations by “project.” Each project has its own chat room, and users can join, send messages, and receive AI-powered responses that are context-aware and up-to-date. All messages are stored in Supabase, enabling real-time updates and historical search. OpenAI’s GPT model powers the assistant replies, leveraging the entire project’s conversation to generate smart, relevant answers. You’re using Supabase’s built-in auth (or a simple user system for now) so everyone on your team has access, and everything is built with the Next.js App Router for scalability and modern best practices. In short, you’re building a team memory and AI assistant that’s always in sync with your real project discussions.
